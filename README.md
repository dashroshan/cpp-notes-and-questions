# C++ Exercise Solutions

- **Book :** Object-Oriented Programming with C++
- **Author :** E. Balagurusamy 

These are my answers to the exercise problems from the above book as I go on learning C++ on my own. Solutions are present in their corresponding chapter directories as individual cpp files with (hopefully) descriptive names. Each solution begins with the question and concludes with the output in the form of comments.
