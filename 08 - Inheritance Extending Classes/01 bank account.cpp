/*
Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called as
savings account and the other as current account. The savings account provides
compound interest and withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The
current account provides cheque book facility but no interest. Current account
holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance falls below
this level, a service charge is imposed.

Create a class account that stores customer name, account number and type of
account. From this derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acet to make them more
specific to their requirements. Include necessary member functions in order to
achieve the following tasks:

(a) Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.
(b) Display the balance.
(c) Compute and deposit interest.
(d) Permit withdrawal and update the balance.
(e) Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, necessary, and update the
balance.

Do not use any constructors. Use member functions to initialize the class
members.
